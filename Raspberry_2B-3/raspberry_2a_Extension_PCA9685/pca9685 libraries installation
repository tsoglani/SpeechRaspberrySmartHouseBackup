sudo apt-get install python-smbus
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools


**i2c-tools
 isn't strictly required, but it's a useful package since you can use it to scan for any I2C or
SMBus devices connected to your board. 
If you know something is connected, but you don't know it's
7-bit I2C address, this library has a great little tool to help you find it. 
python-smbus
 is required, it
adds the I2C support for python!
If you have Raspbian, not Occidentalis check /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf 
and comment
"blacklist i2c-bcm2708"
 by running 
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
 and
 adding
a #
 (if its not there). 
If you're running Wheezy or something-other-than-Occidentalis, you will need to 
add the following lines to /etc/modules 

 i2c-dev 
i2c-bcm2708

and then reboot.
